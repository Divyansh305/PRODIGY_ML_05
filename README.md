Task 5: Food Recognition

This project aims to develop a model that accurately recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The goal is to enable users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices by providing calorie information for various food items.
Project Overview

The food recognition system utilizes deep learning techniques to identify different food items and estimate their calorie values from images. By training the model on a diverse dataset that includes various food types, the model can assist users in maintaining a healthy diet by providing accurate nutritional information.
Key Features

    Food Item Recognition: Classifies a wide range of food items from images.
    Calorie Estimation: Provides estimated calorie content for recognized food items.
    Deep Learning: Employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition.
    User-Friendly Interface: Empowers users to monitor their nutritional intake effectively.
